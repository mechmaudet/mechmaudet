## Sound editing

Working with the poems of argentinian poets Paula Maffia, Andi Nachon, Cecilia Pavon and Diana Bellesi ive made a sound montage. 

I wanted to use not so much of the words or sentences of the poems but more of the silences and breathing that we could hear on the audios. I found that to be more interesting that trying to make a new poem by using there words. 

The result is an uncomfotable piece that feels experimental and ethereal. Because of the different sections that you can hear, it makes the piece interesting and i wanted the user to be engaged by not knowing what could go next.
