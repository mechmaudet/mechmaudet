# Presentation

Hi, I’m @mechmaudet, I’m interested in generative art and coding. Im studying at the Universidad Nacional de las Artes in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

I work as an art director but i wanted to explore technology and what it can do as an art medium.

**Im excited to embark on this journey <3**

On this branch im going to upload all of the different projects that ive worked on for my course, Multimedia Art. Going from coding and making generative art to editing sound among other things.

The way that im going to structure this is by classifying every piece onto there specific branch named after the subject of my course.
